Introduction
---------------
Transferring 3D data between applications has long been a challenge, especially with proprietary formats such as native computer-aided design (CAD) files. 

CAD models are vital for engineering and manufacturing physical products, yet theyâ€™re not designed for the complex, collaborative, and simulation-heavy environments crucial for physical AI applications such as robotics or autonomous vehicles (AVs).
